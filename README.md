# Getting Started with Lofi.co React App

Hello, my name is HungTS, and I created this website. I cloned it to share with my friends and to practice using the ReactJS library to create a SPA website. This website is designed for people who want to study when listening to lofi music. It also supports Spotify and Youtube music `(Coming soon ðŸ”®ðŸ”®)`.
